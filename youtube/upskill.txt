To support your growth, we’ve also included some example code to illustrate how you can refine these areas:
Here are specific code snippets from the uploaded files that can be optimized, along with detailed suggestions for modification:

1. Refactor code to improve modularity and reduce coupling:
   Code Snippet (Before):

     // search_controller.dart
     Future<void> _fetchSuggestions({bool isNewSearch = false}) async {
       final uri = Uri.parse(baseUrl).replace(queryParameters: {
         'part': 'snippet',
         'type': 'video',
         'maxResults': '10',
         'q': query,
         'key': apiKey,
         if (!isNewSearch && _nextPageToken != null) 'pageToken': _nextPageToken!,
       });
   
       final response = await http.get(uri);
       ...
     }

   Suggested Changes:
   Refactor `_fetchSuggestions` to a separate service class to improve modularity and decouple it from the controller logic. This enhances testability and separation of concerns.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // video_service.dart
     class VideoService {
       static Future<http.Response> fetchVideos(String query, String apiKey, {String? nextPageToken}) async {
         final uri = Uri.parse(SearchController.baseUrl).replace(queryParameters: {
           'part': 'snippet',
           'type': 'video',
           'maxResults': '10',
           'q': query,
           'key': apiKey,
           if (nextPageToken != null) 'pageToken': nextPageToken,
         });
   
         return await http.get(uri);
       }
     }
   
     // search_controller.dart
     Future<void> _fetchSuggestions({bool isNewSearch = false}) async {
       final response = await VideoService.fetchVideos(searchQuery.value, apiKey, nextPageToken: isNewSearch ? null : _nextPageToken);
       ...
     }

2. Implement better logging for debugging and auditing:
   Code Snippet (Before):

     // api_service.dart
     Future<void> fetchData() async {
       try {
         // Simulate network call
       } catch (e) {
         Get.snackbar('API Error', e.toString());
       }
     }

   Suggested Changes:
   Replace snackbar messages with structured logging that could be extended to use a logging service.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // api_service.dart
     import 'package:logger/logger.dart';
   
     class ApiService {
       final Logger _logger = Logger();
   
       Future<void> fetchData() async {
         try {
           // Simulate network call
         } catch (e) {
           _logger.e('API Error occurred', e);
         }
       }
     }

3. Enhance error handling for unexpected inputs:
   Code Snippet (Before):

     // network_service.dart
     Future<String> fetchData(String endpoint) async {
       try {
         // Simulate network call
         return 'Data from $endpoint';
       } on SocketException {
         throw Exception('No Internet connection');
       } catch (e) {
         throw Exception('Failed to load data');
       }
     }

   Suggested Changes:
   Include more granular error handling and retry logic for better resilience.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // network_service.dart
     Future<String> fetchData(String endpoint) async {
       int retries = 3;
       while (retries > 0) {
         try {
           // Simulate network call
           return 'Data from $endpoint';
         } on SocketException {
           retries--;
           if (retries == 0) throw Exception('No Internet connection after multiple attempts');
         } catch (e) {
           throw Exception('Failed to load data: $e');
         }
       }
       throw Exception('Failed to establish connection');
     }

4. Security Vulnerabilities: Hard-coded API key should be removed and secured in a more secure way:

   Code Snippet (Before):

     // search_controller.dart
     static const String apiKey = 'AIzaSyAEjXVvF0yt8Dij6g4YqnV7Ju9iTciy5OY';

   Suggested Changes:
   Move the API key to an environment variable or a secure configuration file that is not included in source control. Use Flutter's `dotenv` package for managing environment variables.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // .env
     YOUTUBE_API_KEY=AIzaSyAEjXVvF0yt8Dij6g4YqnV7Ju9iTciy5OY
   
     // search_controller.dart
     import 'package:flutter_dotenv/flutter_dotenv.dart';
   
     String apiKey = dotenv.env['YOUTUBE_API_KEY'] ?? '';

5. Compliance Gaps: Strongly typed error handling is inconsistent across the codebase:

   Code Snippet (Before):

     // api_service.dart
     Future<void> fetchData() async {
       try {
         // Simulate network call
       } catch (e) {
         Get.snackbar('API Error', e.toString());
       }
     }

   Suggested Changes:
   Introduce specific error classes for different error types to provide more meaningful error messages and handling.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // Define custom exceptions
     class NetworkException implements Exception {
       final String message;
       NetworkException(this.message);
     }
   
     // api_service.dart
     Future<void> fetchData() async {
       try {
         // Simulate network call
         throw SocketException('Failed to connect');
       } on SocketException {
         throw NetworkException('No Internet connection');
       } catch (e) {
         Get.snackbar('API Error', 'Unexpected error: $e');
       }
     }

6. Architectural and Memory Management Issues: VideoPlayerController might lead to memory leaks if not properly disposed:

   Code Snippet (Before):

     // shorts_tab.dart
     void _initializeVideoPlayer(int index) {
       if (index < videoUrls.length) {
         _videoController = VideoPlayerController.asset(videoUrls[index])
           ..initialize().then((_) {
             setState(() {});
             _videoController.play();
             _videoController.setLooping(true);
           });
       }
     }

   Suggested Changes:
   Ensure that the previous video player controller is disposed of before initializing a new one.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // shorts_tab.dart
     void _initializeVideoPlayer(int index) {
       if (index < videoUrls.length) {
         if (_videoController != null) {
           _videoController.dispose();
         }
         _videoController = VideoPlayerController.asset(videoUrls[index])
           ..initialize().then((_) {
             setState(() {});
             _videoController.play();
             _videoController.setLooping(true);
           });
       }
     }

These optimizations aim to enhance the codebase's security, compliance, and performance, contributing to improved maintainability and reliability.

Below are some more optimizizations which you can follow:
Here are additional code snippets from the uploaded files that can be optimized:

7. Code Optimization for Readability and Performance:

   Code Snippet (Before):

     // network_service.dart
     Future<String> fetchData(String endpoint) async {
       try {
         // Simulate network call
         await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
         return 'Data from $endpoint';
       } on SocketException {
         throw Exception('No Internet connection');
       } catch (e) {
         throw Exception('Failed to load data');
       }
     }

   Suggested Changes:
   Use a more specific exception for network errors and remove the redundant delay for performance improvement.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // network_service.dart
     Future<String> fetchData(String endpoint) async {
       try {
         // Simulate network call (consider removing delay in production)
         await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
         return 'Data from $endpoint';
       } on SocketException catch (e) {
         throw NetworkException('No Internet connection: ${e.message}');
       } catch (e) {
         throw DataFetchException('Failed to load data: ${e.toString()}');
       }
     }
   
     class NetworkException implements Exception {
       final String message;
       NetworkException(this.message);
     }
   
     class DataFetchException implements Exception {
       final String message;
       DataFetchException(this.message);
     }

8. Code Improvement: Consistency in UI Components:

   Code Snippet (Before):

     // video_card.dart
     Row(
       children: [
         IconButton(
           icon: Icon(Icons.more_vert),
           onPressed: () {},
         ),
       ],
     )

   Suggested Changes:
   Use a consistent style for the buttons by defining the styling in a separate method or widget to ensure uniform appearance across the application.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // video_card.dart
     class VideoCard extends StatelessWidget {
         //...
         Widget _buildActionButton() {
           return IconButton(
             icon: Icon(Icons.more_vert),
             onPressed: () {},
             color: Colors.grey,
           );
         }
   
         @override
         Widget build(BuildContext context) {
           return Row(
             children: [
               _buildActionButton(),
             ],
           );
         }
     }

9. Enhance Developer Experience with Documentation:

   Code Snippet (Before):

     // asset_service.dart
     class AssetService {
       static AssetImage getLogo() {
         return AssetImage('assets/logo/logo.png');
       }
     }

   Suggested Changes:
   Add documentation comments to describe the purpose and usage of public methods.

   Code Snippet (After):

     // asset_service.dart
     /// Service to provide assets for the application.
     class AssetService {
       /// Returns the AssetImage of the app logo.
       static AssetImage getLogo() {
         return AssetImage('assets/logo/logo.png');
       }
     }

These changes aim to improve the overall quality of the codebase, enhancing readability, and maintainability, as well as ensuring best practices in error handling.
